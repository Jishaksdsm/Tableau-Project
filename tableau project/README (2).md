Tableau Project: Human Development Index Analysis


Description
This Tableau project focuses on analyzing the Human Development Index (HDI) data for various countries. The project utilizes Tableau visualizations to explore the relationship between HDI and indicators such as life expectancy, expected years of schooling, mean years of schooling, and gross national income.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes information on HDI, life expectancy, schooling, and gross national income for different countries. The dataset columns include:

Country: Name of the country
Human_Development_Index (HDI): HDI value representing the country's overall development
Life_expectancy_at_birth: Life expectancy at birth in years
Expected_years_of_schooling: Average number of years of education expected for a child
Mean_years_of_schooling: Average number of years of education received by the population
Gross_national_income: Gross National Income (GNI) per capita
GNI_per_capita_rank_minus_HDI_rank: Difference between GNI per capita rank and HDI rank
HDI_rank: HDI rank of the country

Interacting with the Visualizations
To interact with the Tableau visualizations, use the following features:

Use filters to select specific countries, years, or indicators of interest.
Hover over data points to view detailed information.
Use the zoom feature to focus on specific areas of the visualizations.


Conclusion
This Tableau project provides valuable insights into the Human Development Index and its relationship with various indicators. By visualizing the data, patterns and correlations can be identified, contributing to a better understanding of the development levels across different countries.
